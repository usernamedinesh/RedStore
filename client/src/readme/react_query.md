# React Query

why use

- **Server State Management**: React Query is designed to handle server state, which is often complex and requires synchronization with the server.
- **Data Fetching**: It simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server.
- **Automatic Caching**: React Query automatically caches data, reducing the need for redundant network requests.
- **Background Updates**: It can automatically refetch data in the background to keep the UI up-to-date.
- **Optimistic Updates**: React Query supports optimistic updates, allowing for a smoother user experience by updating the UI before the server confirms the change.
